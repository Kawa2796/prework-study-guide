# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This prework study guide was created for the bootcamp to give us students, practice and to begin developing basic understanding and knowledge on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. These basic skills we be developed further during our time in the bootcamp. This was a fun project to not only introduce us to these topics, but its also a way for us to look back on and see how much we've grown during out time in the bootcamp. The notes provided were key points that we learned throughout this lesson that we can use to look back on.
